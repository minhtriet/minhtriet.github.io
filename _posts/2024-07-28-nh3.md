title:  Optimizing the Geometry of the Haber-Bosch Process Using Quantum Computing
excerpt: Can quantum computer do DFT with the help of Machine learning?
---

**TLDR**: We contribute an approach to simulate chemistry reaction with (1) catalyst and (2) endothermicity.

# Introduction
The Haber-Bosch process enables the large-scale synthesis of amonia . Its reaction is
$$\begin{align}\text{N}_2 + 3\text{H}_2 \overset{Fe}{\longrightarrow} 2\text{NH}_3 \end{align}$$. 

This process, however, is energy-intensive and relies catalysts. Understand the reaction pathway with catalyst hopes to gain insights into the process, thus enhance its efficiency. 

To tackle this type of problem currently the workflow is Fig.1 is the most widely applied.

It shows that most of the steps use DFT in a classical computer and the quantum computer only calculate the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. This post explores how we can use Pennylane to execute the first steps with limited computer resource. Concretely, we replicate the on the first three steps of [1] in Figure 2, which are the most complex reactions in the whole pathway.

# Method
There are two methods in use, gradient descent and Bayesian optimization. The former has good coverage in [Pennylane demo](). Here we focus on the latter.

## Motivation
To define a affine transformation for a molecule, we need to define translation parameter $$t_x, t_y, t_z$$ and rotational parameter $$\theta_x,\theta_y,\theta_z$$. When calculating the gradientfor gradient descent, we need to know $$t_\bullet \pm \Delta_t$$ and $$\theta_\bullet \pm \Delta_\theta$$
Each time we query the function is expensive (Hamiltionian)


## Steps
Define a seqquential of steps, gradient-less. We treat the Hamiltonian as a black box function and optimize for the energy. We use the acquision function $$\alpha$$ to optain new positions and pass then to the Hamilton, keeping log of them and estimate the posterior value of the Hamiltonian.
The probability of exeeding $$v$$, build the expected value of $$H$$

Acquisition function $$\alpha$$, given the $$H$$ and $$X$$, what is the next point we want to evaluate

The reaction pathway for the Harber Bosch reaction is as follow.

When going from a joint distribution to a conditional distribution, we refer readers to [3]

We experiment with two variational methods: Bayesian optimization (BO) and Gradient descent. Bayesian optimization is derivative-free and can overcome some draw back of gradient descent in cases that we would detail in later parts.

The lowest peak reminds us of Gaussian bell, hence why not use the Guassian process here?
1. Varies the coordinates of the reactant: The transition in $$x,y,z$$ axis and rotation angle around its center. 
2. Construct the Hamiltonian
3. Measure and Optimize: Measure the expectation value of the Hamiltonian using the quantum circuit and optimize the parameters using a classical optimizer to minimize this value.

## Step 2
Note the added energy ($$0.98$$) below the arrow. It means it is an endothermic reaction and gradient descent (Middle) would have to work particularly hard to escape the  that we have to add the energies to the system. On the other hand, the BO can overcome that better.

The search boundary condition is of utmost important. Here we set each edge of the searching bound to be $$1 nm$$ bigger than the catalyst substrate. After the above result, we modify the search space as below.

## Compare Gradient descent with BO

## Limitation
1. Due to the lack of computational resource we have to reduce the catalyst platform, number of active orbitals and electrions
2. The number of active electrons and oribtals. These parameters are visible to`chem_config.yaml`
3. Setting the bound of the BO is critical to a good learning result. Even when we receive the minima, it would be interesting to see if gradient descent can further finetune the result.

The parameters of free electrons and free orbitals are crucial here. A full configuration interaction can take up to TBs of RAM to calculate
