title:  Optimizing the Geometry of the Haber-Bosch Process Using Quantum Computing
excerpt: Can quantum computer do DFT with the help of Machine learning?

# Introduction

The Haber-Bosch process enables the large-scale synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen. Its reaction is: $$\text{N}_2 + 3\text{H}_2 \overset{Fe}{\longrightarrow} 2\text{NH}_3$$. This process, however, is energy-intensive and relies heavily on iron-based catalysts to lower the activation energy and increasing the reaction rate.

Optimizing the geometry of the catalyst's surface can significantly enhance its efficiency. Traditionally, this optimization is performed using Density Functional Theory (DFT), but quantum computing offers an alternative. What might our contribution be?

This post explores how quantum computing can be used to optimize the geometry of a Haber-Bosch process using the Fe 211 catalyst.


The parameters of free electrons and free orbitals are crucial here. A full configuration interaction can take up to TBs of RAM to calculate 

# The Haber-Bosch Process and Fe 211 Catalyst





# Quantum Computing for Geometry Optimization

To optimize the Fe 211 catalyst geometry for the Haber-Bosch process using VQE, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Construct the Hamiltonian**: Represent the electronic structure of the Fe 211 catalyst and the interacting molecules (N₂ and H₂) using a Hamiltonian.
2. **Prepare Initial State**: Use a quantum circuit to prepare an initial guess for the ground state wavefunction of the system.
3. **Parameterize the Circuit**: Introduce parameters in the quantum circuit that can be adjusted to modify the wavefunction.
4. **Measure and Optimize**: Measure the expectation value of the Hamiltonian using the quantum circuit and optimize the parameters using a classical optimizer to minimize this value.
5. **Geometry Optimization**: Adjust the atomic positions and repeat the VQE steps until the optimal geometry is found.

# Comparison to Density Functional Theory (DFT)

DFT is a widely used classical method for calculating electronic structures and optimizing geometries. It approximates the many-body problem of interacting electrons using functionals of the electron density.

### Advantages of Quantum Computing over DFT

- **Accuracy**: Quantum algorithms can provide more accurate solutions for the electronic structure, especially for systems with strong electron correlations.
- **Scalability**: As quantum hardware improves, the ability to handle larger and more complex systems will surpass DFT capabilities.

### Current Limitations

- **Hardware**: Quantum computers are still in the early stages of development, with limited qubits and coherence times.
- **Error Rates**: Quantum computations are prone to errors, requiring sophisticated error correction techniques.

## Practical Applications and Real-World Implications

The successful application of quantum computing to optimize the Haber-Bosch process could lead to:

- **Energy Efficiency**: More efficient catalysts can reduce the energy consumption of the Haber-Bosch process, lowering costs and environmental impact.
- **Enhanced Production**: Optimized catalysts can increase ammonia production rates, meeting global demand more effectively.
- **Broad Impact**: The methodologies developed can be applied to other catalytic processes, revolutionizing industrial chemistry.
