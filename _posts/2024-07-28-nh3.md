# Introduction
The Haber-Bosch process enables the large-scale synthesis of amonia . Its reaction is
$$\begin{align}\text{N}_2 + 3\text{H}_2 \overset{Fe}{\longrightarrow} 2\text{NH}_3 \end{align}$$. 

This process, however, is energy-intensive and relies heavily on iron-based catalysts to lower the activation energy and increasing the reaction rate. Understand the reaction pathway with catalyst hopes to gain insights into the process, thus enhance its efficiency. 

To tackle this type of problem currently the workflow is Fig.1 is the most widely applied.

This figure shows that most of the steps are ran in a classical computer and the quantum computer only calculate the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. This post explores how we can use Pennylane to execute the first steps with limited computer resource.
# Method


Each time we query the function is expensive (Hamiltionian)

Define a seqquential of steps, gradient-less. We treat the Hamiltonian as a black box function that outputs the energy. What we are doing is making observation, keeping log of them and estimate the posterior value of the Hamiltonian.

The probability of exeeding $$v$$, build the expected value of $$H$$

Acquisition function $$\alpha$$, given the $$H$$ and $$X$$, what is the next point we want to evaluate

The reaction pathway for the Harber Bosch reaction is as follow.

We experiment with two variational methods: Bayesian optimization (BO) and Gradient descent. Bayesian optimization is derivative-free and can overcome some draw back of gradient descent in cases that we would detail in later parts.


1. **Construct the Hamiltonian**:
2. Represent the electronic structure of the Fe 211 catalyst and the interacting molecules for each intermediate step using a Hamiltonian.
3. The transition in $$x,y,z$$ axis and rotation angle around its center. 
4. **Parameterize the Circuit**: Introduce parameters in the quantum circuit that can be adjusted to modify the wavefunction.
5. **Measure and Optimize**: Measure the expectation value of the Hamiltonian using the quantum circuit and optimize the parameters using a classical optimizer to minimize this value.
6. **Geometry Optimization**: Adjust the atomic positions and repeat the VQE steps until the optimal geometry is found.

## Limitation

2. The number of active electrons and oribtals. These parameters are visible to`chem_config.yaml`





The parameters of free electrons and free orbitals are crucial here. A full configuration interaction can take up to TBs of RAM to calculate

## Step 2
Note the added energy ($$0.98$$) below the arrow. It means it is an endothermic reaction and gradient descent (Middle) would have to work particularly hard to escape the  that we have to add the energies to the system. On the other hand, the BO can overcome that better.
