excerpt: What I have read

## 2020
### July
- Think Like a Rocket Scientist: Simple Strategies You Can Use to Make Giant Leaps in Work and Life - Ozan Varol
- Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days - Jake Knapp

Definitely some overlaps in methods here, reminding of the snow ball effect. One does not give in to greed, get comfortable with unknowns and solve them

### August
I still read Think Like a Rocket Scientist. Thinking on one's feet might as well be a superpower now. Same thing in music making though, I have heard people said they want to quit music after listening to Herbie Hancock or Jacob Collier many times, which I hope is purely jokes

### September
Bad blood, one hell of a depressing read. EH may have treated people badly, but according to what I've read till now, we don't know what the causes are. Is she like this from the beginning?

### November
Update on Bad blood: I still do not know the causes of the way people run Theranos that way.

## 2021
### January
Merchants of Doubt. I thought Bad blood was depressing, oh boy how wrong I was. Moral compass and choices were underrated.
