### Health hackathon
In 49 hours, create an health care app. ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jvhackingfest/?fref=nf)) ([Featured in Tech in Asia](https://www.techinasia.com/jv-hacking-fest-healthcare-hackathon-vietnam))

**What I like:** Cool mentors. A dude gamified a hydration reminder. I teamed up with some random dudes right on the day of the hackathon, our ragtag team won 2nd price.

### Bachelor thesis
Use Machine Learning to fix Shibboleth for Vietnamese language speakers [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_phonology#Initial_consonants)

**What I like:** Big impact, as 22.27% teachers and students of the capital city ([Source in Vietnamese](https://kenhtuyensinh.vn/gan-47000-giao-vien-va-hoc-sinh-noi-ngong)), our supervisor included, suffers from shibboleth. I lead in the team, and this project introduced me to machine learning and tried my hand at data collection and model deployment.


### Industrial robotics software
Pose estimation on a table top environment, with whole dataset consist of two images. My work is in University of Bonn's (EuroC Challenge)[https://web.archive.org/web/20191204203324/http://www.euroc-project.eu/index.php?id=nimbro_manufacturing], [Paper](\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04134)

**What I like:** How to adapt when our training data consists of RGBD data of one images, and still deliver (A company named igus GmbH bought our work!)

### Master thesis
Gas price prediction

**What I like:** I step away from accepting the model as the black box and try to wrestle some sense out of it, which I found most papers that I've read lagging behind. Finally get to [publish it](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2611/paper2.pdf)
An analyse about what words may trigger the gas price. It is the table 6 in my work.

### Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation (NERD) with Wikidata
Is it possible to do NERD in short queries, where there is fewer grammar clues or captitalization like in a sentence? 
Would the first and second Harry Potter `watch **harry potter** vs read **harry potter**?` be resolved to `film` and `book`?
I create a demo [here](http://54.91.75.203/).

**What I like** I did everything and tried my hand with ReactJS. I divise tests just to see which 2 words are.

**What I could do better** I deployed it on a tiny machine to test the performance, but EC2 with education account somehow do not allow me to scale the instance up (?). Also could not find a Wikidata NERD dataset
