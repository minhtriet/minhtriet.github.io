What I like: Cool mentors. I saw a dude able to gamify a hydration reminder in 2 days 1 night, note that this was in 2013, before Apple integrate those in their Health app. I team up with some dudes, we won 2nd price.
What could do better: I could have influenced the team direction more and probably save us about four hours * 4 people.
Facebook page, Some write up
