### Health hackathon
In 48 hours, my team created a E-Prescription, an Android app to remind patients to take their medicine. 

**What I like:** 1) In Vietnam, antibiotics are overused as one do not need doctor's prescription to buy. This has caused Vietnam to be among the most overly tolerant antibiotic countries in the world. This app is aim to solve this problem.

### Bachelor thesis
Use Machine Learning to fix [shibboleth for Vietnamese language speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_phonology#Initial_consonants)

**What I like:** Big impact, as 22.27% teachers and students of the capital city ([Source in Vietnamese](https://kenhtuyensinh.vn/gan-47000-giao-vien-va-hoc-sinh-noi-ngong)), our supervisor included, suffers from shibboleth. I lead in the team, and this project introduced me to machine learning and tried my hand at data collection and model deployment.

### Industrial robotics software
Pose estimation on a table top environment, with whole dataset consist of two images. My work is in University of Bonn's [EuroC Challenge](https://web.archive.org/web/20191204203324/http://www.euroc-project.eu/index.php?id=nimbro_manufacturing), [Paper](\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04134)

**What I like:** How to adapt when our training data consists of RGBD data of one images, and still deliver (CitroÃ«n bought our work!)

### Rapid road detection
Road detection with 50% faster intepretation time and retain more than 95% quality. [Implementation](https://github.com/minhtriet/clockwork-kitti) [Write up](arxiv)

**What I like:** My first computer vision project. Seeing the result of the work in the visual form was quite a sensation.

**What I could do better:** The write up was rough around the edge. I polished the tables in the link above.


### Master thesis
Gas price prediction

**What I like:** I step away from accepting the model as the black box and try to wrestle some sense out of it, which I found most papers that I've read lagging behind. Top ten most influential words to gas price according to my model. It is the table 6 in my work.

### Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation (NERD) with Wikidata
Is it possible to do NERD in short queries, where there is fewer grammar clues or captitalization like in a sentence? 
Would `watch [harry potter] vs read [harry potter]` be resolved to `Harry Potter film` and `Harry Potter book`?
I create a demo [here](http://54.91.75.203/).

**What I like:** Tried my hand with ReactJS. I divise tests to see if cosine distance of different Word Embeddings suit the short text nature
