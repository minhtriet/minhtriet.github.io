### Health hackathon
#### Challenge 
In 49 hours, create an app around the topic of health. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jvhackingfest/?fref=nf) [Write up](https://www.techinasia.com/jv-hacking-fest-healthcare-hackathon-vietnam)

#### What I like
Cool mentors. I saw a dude gamify a hydration reminder. I team up with some random dudes on the day of the hackathon, we won 2nd price.
What could do better: Could have influenced the team direction more and probably save us 4 hours * 4 people.

### Bachelor thesis
#### Challenge
Machine Learning to fix Shibboleth in Vietnam [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_phonology#Initial_consonants)

#### What I like
Meaningful project because the supervisor suffer from shibboleth. Leader in the team who all are older than I am. Introduced me to machine learning and tried my hand at data collection and model deployment.

#### What I could do better
The machine learning model sounds cool but not everything. What matters at the end is the product I deliver.

###

Computer vision on how to find things on a table top environment. Got purchased by .... Paper here

driving autonomously ... A GIF here


### Master thesis

What make me proud I stop accepting the model as the black box and try to wrestle some sense out of it, which I found most papers that I've read lagging behind. Finally get to publish it
An analyse about what words may trigger the gas price


### NERD 

#### What I like
I the test just to see which 2 words are

#### What I could do better
I deployed it on a tiny machine to test the performance, but EC2 with education account somehow do not allow me to scale the instance up (?)
